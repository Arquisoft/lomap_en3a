== Solution Strategy

=== Technology decisions

==== Framework: React
Although it is not as powerful as other options (like Angular), it is enough for developing this application and it is
less difficult to learn the basics, that is, the learning curve is faster. This idea is supported by its big community,
the introduction we have been given in class and the amount of projects of the course that have been developed with it
and that we can take as reference.

==== Language: TypeScript/JavaScript
It is the most spread option for developing web applications in React, so we expect to find enough resources to develop
our projects, in terms of information sources and libraries. Also, most of the members have worked with JavaScript in
SEW, so the transition to TypeScript should be smoother.

==== Database: MongoDB
As our centralized database only stores public places, there is no relation between entities that should be taken into
account, so document databases arise as a good option, as they have good performance and flexible schema. Also, given
that we are working with Typescript, we can rely on MongoDB NodeJS drivers that make the task easier (such as Mongoose).
In addition, we have free access to a cloud storage of 512MB, an option that many providers do not offer. Finally, it
is important to mention we have used it in other subject (SDI), so the adaptation and learning process should not be a
concern.

=== Top-level decomposition of the system
Some patterns have been discussed to tackle the design of the solution. This section is expected to be updated during
the development of the application, as we will face different situations and problems where some patterns can fit in
and we will reason about the best choice.

==== Architectural patterns
* *MVC (model-view-controller)*: It is very used in the development of web applications. We expect to have the view
(user interface) on the client, separated from the domain logic and the persistence, which are located on the server.

==== Design patterns
* *Façade*: Given the complexity of some subsystems and modules of the application, it could be reasonable to
use a reduced interface to just focus on what we need about them, simplifying their usage.

* *Adapter*: We assume that we will use third-party elements (libraries, etc). For this reason, we have thought about
this pattern already to connect our code with them, as it is very handy in this kind of situations.

=== Decisions for achieving quality goals
[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Quality goal|Solution approach|Details

| _Privacy_
| _All user data will be stored in a personal pod, so that the user has exclusive access to them, being also able to
grant the access to more people._
| _Section 8 (Persistence), Section 9 (ADR 1)_

| _Robustness_
| _Validations of user input on client-side will be performed so that there is no risk of inconsistencies, security
issues, etc. Server-side validations are done by means of "express-validator" on each request made to the server (check
the fields have correct values) to make sure that no corrupt data is stored on the database._
|

| _Usability_
| _Familiarity will be prioritized over innovation, so that users can rely on intuition to navigate and explore the
application. In this way, several interfaces from applications that have well-proven usability (i.e. Google Maps) will
be reviewed to design the user interface of the application. Aesthetics will be taken into account so it is appealing
to use._
| _Section 8 (UI/UX)_

=== Organizational decisions
For the development of this project, the following platforms and mechanisms have been adopted to enhance
the workflow among the members of the team.

* *WhatsApp*: A group has been created as the quickest communication mechanism to inform the other members about any
update or news and organize meetings.

* *Teams*: Platform where extra meetings (outside of the university) take place.

* *Github*: Platform where the project is managed. We have a repository in which we develop the project. We have decided
to follow what is called "Trunk-based development". This consists on having a develop branch, from which we create the
branches to code. We merge them in this develop branch and, once we have everything ready, we merge develop to master.
In this way, every merge to master consists on a new release (deliverable). The Github tools that we use will be
presented, along with their role in the development process.

** *Wiki*: Here, we create a new entry to record the minute of each reunion that takes place. Each minute has a
specific format, and it contains the following sections:
*** *Date*
*** *Participants*
*** *Agreements (about work assignment)*
*** *State of previous tasks*: They may include links to issues and/or pull requests.
*** *Description of decisions taken*: Sometimes they are included in the agreements section.

** *Issues*: The way to register every important event (tasks to do, problems to solve, doubts…).

** *Kanban*: The place where we add and update the state of issues that are related to the development.

** *Pull request*: We create them for every merge to develop or master, so that everyone can review what has been done
and approve the changes, or reject them (being able to comment what should be fixed).

=== Workflow example
To complete the previous explanation, let us put an example of the steps we do to fulfill a task.

* The task is defined on a meeting, so it is recorded in the corresponding minute.
* An issue is created for the task. It is placed on the Kanban ("Open" state).
* A branch will be created for developing it. We move the issue to "In progress" state in the Kanban.
* Once it is finished, a pull request is sent for merging with the develop branch.
** If it is accepted, the process is finished, so the issue may be closed. We move the issue to the "Finished" state in
the Kanban and the branch can be deleted.
** If it is rejected, the needed fixes are performed, and the pull request is updated with them. A new revision takes
place.
* If a bug is discovered after merging, a new branch may be created and the issue is reopened. Also, it is placed again
on the "In progress" state of the Kanban.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the system's architecture. These include

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.
