== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== POD's structure information
----
|-lomap
    |-data
        |-interactions
            |-comments
            |-reviews
    	|-maps
	    |-places
----
This is the general structure of the folders in each user POD and each folder has different
datasets.

* *Places*: There is one folder inside for each place created, named with a unique ID and inside
of them there are datasets, one for each comment, review and image about that place.

* *Maps*: The are inside datasets one for each map created by the user. Each one have links to
different places which are stored at the same time in the places folder as said before.

* *Interactions*: It has two folders (comments and interactions) and each one has each
correspondant datasets.

The permissions in order to set a place only visible for everyone, a group of people or
none other than the owner himself, are managed from the application with the necessary library to
change the permissions of them. That  is the reason why any
other extra folder to classify the places is not necessary and instead are used datasets.

=== UI/UX:
The application will consist of a webpage application where the user will be able to choose between a public map or different views that the user creates. This map will only show the minimal information in the form of “pins”. The user can click on the pin that a place represents, and the full information will be loaded and prompted. In this page there will be the possibility of adding photos, comments and reviews or view the ones added by other members. A friendly and familiar approach will be held when designing the different views of the application; Google Maps will be the main reference. 

=== Persistence:
The persistence module of this development consists of the Pod's service and our database that will store basic information from public places. The user's system will make a call to our server to get the information that will populate the public map, then it will only call the personal pods when the information is needed (load on demand). With the same structure as for the public map, it is possible to create maps that will be stored only in the user's pod that will be downloaded to populate that map. The user's device will make calls to all the personal pods of its friends in the same way as for the public places. This way, we ensure that the server-side application is not going to process data that the user has only shared with his friends and, at the same time, will make that sharing possible. 

=== Access permissions
To keep information secure, a system is needed to control access to a pod's resources based on the user's identity, including whether they are a friend or belong to a group of approved users. The owner of a pod has exclusive editing rights, which means that public or shared pods can only be edited by the owner. The only person who can access a pod is the owner, who can then decide whether to share it with other people or groups. The pod can be changed only by its owner or under predetermined circumstances, such as sending a review, uploading a photo, or giving a rating.

=== Communication and integration:
The client side of the application will be able to work independently from the server side for accessing private places, but it will not be able to access the public maps. The connection between the client and server will make it possible to display the map service, and to show the different public places of the application. That way we ensure that the service we supply does not completely rely on the rest-API. Also, the connection to pods, owned or not by the user, will allow to show private places and maps. A standard way of communicating with the pods should be established to be compatible with other “LoMap” applications. The standard has not yet been implemented; it is due to be negotiated (In our case it has not been implemented due to lack of time). The application will have to implement a module for connecting with the Solid Pods technology and other services that will be needed such as a map API or other web services.

=== Architecture and or design patterns:
In an earlier subject, Software design, different patterns have been set up. The usage of the corresponding adapter pattern will be used when dealing with any API needed.
More patterns are described in section 4.

=== Rules for using specific technology:
Privacy is a main concern when developing this application. There should be a major reason for treating in the server-side private information of a user instead of on their own device. Therefore, we don't manage private information unless is strictly necessary, such as URLs.
When working with specific technologies such as Solid Pods, MongoDB or React those frameworks and technologies have their own rules that are mandatory.

=== Deployment:
We have chosen node.js as the runtime environment for running the server-side application. The deployment of the application will consist of a Docker container for the “web App” and another for the “rest API”. A set of actions will be configured such as unitary testing, integration tests, automatic deployment for “web App” and for “rest API”. During the process of deployment, we have faced several problems, such as the requirement of a “SSL” certificate for the Inrupt login to work or another for the API for the requests to be sent. We have used “Lets crypt” to generate the certificates, “Certbot” to enable the certificates and the free “dns” service “ClouDNS” for the domain name. The deployment is done on a virtual machine on the cloud service Azure.
