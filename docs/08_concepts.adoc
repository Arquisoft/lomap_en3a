== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== POD's structure information
----
|-lomap
    |-data
    	|-maps
	    |-places
----

The permissions in order to set a place only visible for everyone, a group of people or
none other than the owner himself, are managed from the POD itself. That is the reason why any
other extra folder to classify the places is not necessary.

=== UI/UX:
The application will consist of a webpage application where the user will be able to choose between a public map or different views that the user creates. This map will only show the minimal information as form of “pins”. The user can click on the pin that a place represents, and the full information will be loaded and prompted. A friendly and familiar approach will be hold when designing the different views of the application; Google Maps will be the main reference.

=== Persistence:
The persistence module of this development consists of the Pod’s service and our database that will store some basic information from the public places. The user’s system will make a call to our server to get the information that will populate the public map, then will only call the personal pods when the information is needed (load on demand). The user’s device will make calls to all the personal pods of its friends in the same way as for the public places. This way, we ensure that the server-side application is not going to process data that the user has only shared with his friends and, at the same time, will make that sharing possible.

=== Transaction handling:
A system for implementing transactions will be required for keeping redundant information in sync. The owner of a place is the only one that can edit it, in this way, public places can only been edited by its owner. The changes that a user makes must be reflected onto the Solid Pod and the Database simultaneously.

=== Communication and integration:
The client side of the application will not be able to operate independent to the server side. The connection between the client and server will make possible to display the map service, and to show the different public places of the application. A standard way of communicating with the pods should be stablished in order to be compatible with other LoMap applications. The standard is not yet been implemented, it is due to be negotiated. The application will have to implement a module for connecting with the Solid Pods technology and other services that will be needed such as a map API or other web services.

=== Architecture and or design patterns:
In previous a subject, Software design, different patterns have been stablished. The usage of the corresponding adapter pattern will be used when dealing with any API needed.
More patterns are described on the section 4.

=== Rules for using specific technology:
Privacy is a main concern when developing this application. There should be a major reason for treating in the server-side private information of a user instead of on their own device.

=== Deployment:
We have chosen node.js as the runtime environment for running the server-side application.
