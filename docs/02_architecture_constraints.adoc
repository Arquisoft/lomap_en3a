== Architecture Constraints

=== Table 1. Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="2,2"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|*SOLID for Personal data storage*
|The data of each user will be stored in a personal pod, following SOLID principles.

|*Github*
|Github is required for developing the project. Team members must upload their current work to coordinate with the teammates and to record what they have done.
|===

=== Table 2. Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|*Team size*
|It has been decided that the team is formed by 5 members.

|*Schedule*
|The project must be developed during the semester, with several deadlines in between.

|*Budget*
|The development team will not have any financial support, so any outlay will be on their side.

|*External workload*
|The team members have more subjects with their own workload. This is, the team must organize itself so that the semester work can be combined with the project development.

|*Research*
|We know about programming, mainly in Java, but we have not dealt with some aspects that must be developed in this project, such as application deployment or SOLID, so we must spend time to learn about them. Others are more familiar but there is still work to do to be able to handle them.

=== Table 3. Conventions

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|_Language_
|The documentation must be done using an ARC42 template.

|_Code conventions_
|The code should follow the conventions of the programming language we use and shall be done addressing good coding practices (i.e. low coupling for maintainability).

|_User-friendliness_
|This is a general-use application, so it has to be appealing and easy to use, as well as accessible to the widest range of people possible.

.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
