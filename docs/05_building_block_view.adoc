== Building Block View

=== White Box Overall System

.Overview Diagram
image:05_Building_Block_Overall_View.PNG['Overall View of the System']

Motivation::
This is an overall view of the system that describes only the most important present interfaces.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Block|Description
|PODs|The main storage system, each user has his information stored in his own private POD.
|Map API|API that allows to obtain the map to be displayed.
|Data Base|Stores the minimum information required for the public map to load.
|User|Represents how each individual user is set to interact with the system, through LoMap and storing his information on his POD.
|===
Important Interfaces::
The most important interfaces, (described in the next levels) are the ones in charge of the communication with the PODs manager and the database.

=== Infrastructure
image:05_Building_Block_Level_1_1.jpg['White Box 1.1']

Purpose::
It is the Infrastructure of the application, the RestApi and the WebApp both interact with external interfaces and APIs,
these interfaces are represented in this level.

Interfaces::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Interface|Description
|PODManager|Manages the storing of information inside the PODs provider
|PlaceManager|Manages the storing of places and maps inside the PODs
|SessionManager|Manages the users session, is the one in charge of the login, logout,etc...
|FriendsManager|Is the one that obtains the list of friends from the user, as well as their information
|LeafletMapAdapter|Is the class that interacts with the Map API and presents it to the UI
|PlacesController|This controller is the one in charge of adding and deleting places in the Mongo database
|api|This class is the one that communicates with the RestApi, it interacts with it in order to store the places in the database

==== Business model
Level 1::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 1.svg['First level of the business model']
* *api*: Is the one in charge of communicating the webapp with the rest api in the server side.
It is implemented with the CRUD functions although, although only the one retrieving all the public
places is being used for the moment.
* *App*: It is the main module from which the application starts. It uses directly the function
for getting all the public places in the database and also the rest of modules conforming the
UI.
Level 2::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 2.svg['Second level of the business model']
* *PODManager*: Is the class in charge of doing all the interactions between the application and
the PODs like getting public, private or friends places, maps, etc.
* *Assembler*: It is in charge of transforming the objects in domain model of the web application
into Things or Datasets for later storing them in PODs or viceversa.
* *LeafletMapAdapter*: It is in charge of adapt the Leaflet api to our application in order to
display the desired map with the information of places stored in PODs.
Level 3::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 2.svg['Third level (domain model) of the business model']
* *Placemark*: Is the graphical representation of a Place. Although now it stores
nothing related with the appearance, it could be in the future. However, it will always store the
minimal information of a place to be display in a map as a mark. This was done because in terms of
performance when showing all the public places published in the web app it is better.

=== LoMap Architecture

image:05_Building_Block_Level_1.PNG['System Level 1']

Purpose::
Describes the architecture of the inner LoMap system, it's how the system is structured and how each layer interacts within the system.
The architecture described in the diagram _System Level 1_ is a Clean Architecture.

Interfaces::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Interface|Description
|Entities|Represent the domain of the system, those classes that describe the enterprise business rules.
|App Business Logic|The use cases, the actual application business rules that describe how the application works.
|Presentation|The related documents that are in charge of the presentation of the application.
|Infrastructure|Those external interfaces that interact with the application, including the Database Management System, the APIs that are used (Map API), the PODs provider and any other external service.
