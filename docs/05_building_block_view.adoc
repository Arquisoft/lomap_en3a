== Building Block View

=== White Box Overall System

.Overview Diagram
image:05_Building_Block_Overall_View.PNG['Overall View of the System']

Motivation::
This is an overall view of the system that describes only the most important present interfaces.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Block|Description
|PODs|The main storage system, each user has his information stored in his own private POD.
|Map API|API that allows to obtain the map to be displayed.
|Data Base|Stores the minimum information required for the public map to load.
|User|Represents how each individual user is set to interact with the system, through LoMap and storing his information on his POD.
|===
Important Interfaces::
The most important interfaces, (described in the next levels) are the ones in charge of the communication with the PODs manager and the database.

=== LoMap Architecture

image:05_Building_Block_Level_1.PNG['System Level 1']

Purpose::
Describes the architecture of the inner LoMap system, it's how the system is structured and how each layer interacts within the system.
The architecture described in the diagram _System Level 1_ is a Clean Architecture.

Interfaces::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Interface|Description
|Entities|Represent the domain of the system, those classes that describe the enterprise business rules.
|Presentation|The related documents that are in charge of the presentation of the application.
|Infrastructure|Those external interfaces that interact with the application, including the Database Management System, the APIs that are used (Map API), the PODs provider and any other external service.
|===

=== Infrastructure
image:05_Building_Block_Level_1_1.jpg['White Box 1.1']

Purpose::
It is the Infrastructure of the application, the RestApi and the WebApp both interact with external interfaces and APIs,
these interfaces are represented in this level.

Interfaces::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Interface|Description
|PODManager|Manages the storing of information inside the PODs provider
|SessionManager|Manages the users session, is the one in charge of the login, logout,etc...
|FriendsManager|Is the one that obtains the list of friends from the user, as well as their information
|LeafletMapAdapter|Is the class that interacts with the Map API and presents it to the UI
|PlacesController|This controller is the one in charge of adding and deleting places in the Mongo database
|api|This class is the one that communicates with the RestApi, it interacts with it in order to store the places in the database
|===

Level 1: Solid adapters and repositories::
image:05_Building_Block_Level_1_1_1.jpg['White Box 1.1']
Purpose::
These adapters and repositories,  placed under _webapp/src/adapters_, are meant to interact with the SOLID POD provider of the user in order to execute,
the possible actions over his POD, that is to store places, reviews, comments, etc. They have been organized in this
way to provide an easier access and maintainability.

=== Presentation
image:05_Building_Block_Level_1_2.jpg['White Box 1.1']

Purpose::
For the presentation level of the architecture, the system is divided on several folders placed under _webapp/src_.
These folders contain mainly components and pages, which form the base of the user interface.

Distribution::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Folder|Description
|adapters|Contains the classes that render an adapted version of the map
|components|This class contains all the components that are used inside the pages, to represent different zones of the application.
|components/basic|Some base components that serve as plain templates to represent tables, lists, etc.
|components/map|The components related to either information about the map or the map itself.
|components/place|The components related to information about the places
|components/social|The components related to the users social state, lists of friends, groups ,etc.
|pages|Located in this folder are the main pages of the application, the ones that are either on the nav menu or important to display.
|styles|The css styles for all the components
|styles/fonts|The text fonts for all the components
|assets|Elements such as markers that are meant to be used in components.

==== Rest API


==== Business model
Level 1::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 1.svg['First level of the business model']
* *api*: Is the one in charge of communicating the webapp with the rest api in the server side.
It is implemented with the CRUD functions although, although only the one retrieving all the public
places is being used for the moment.
* *App*: It is the main module from which the application starts. It uses directly the function
for getting all the public places in the database and also the rest of modules conforming the
UI.
Level 2::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 2.svg['Second level of the business model']
* *PODManager*: Is the class in charge of doing all the interactions between the application and
the PODs like getting public, private or friends places, maps, etc.
* *Assembler*: It is in charge of transforming the objects in domain model of the web application
into Things or Datasets for later storing them in PODs or viceversa.
* *LeafletMapAdapter*: It is in charge of adapt the Leaflet api to our application in order to
display the desired map with the information of places stored in PODs.
Level 3::
image:businessmodel/Business model Level 2.svg['Third level (domain model) of the business model']
* *Placemark*: Is the graphical representation of a Place. Although now it stores
nothing related with the appearance, it could be in the future. However, it will always store the
minimal information of a place to be display in a map as a mark. This was done because in terms of
performance when showing all the public places published in the web app it is better.
