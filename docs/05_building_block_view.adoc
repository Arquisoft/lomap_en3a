== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

.Overview Diagram
image:05_Building_Block_Overall_View.PNG['Overall View of the System']

Motivation::
This is an overall view of the system that describes only the most important present interfaces.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Block|Description
|PODs|The main storage system, each user has his information stored in his own private POD.
|Map API|API that allows to obtain the map to be displayed.
|Data Base|Stores the minimum information required for the public map to load.
|User|Represents how each individual user is set to interact with the system, through LoMap and storing his information on his POD.
|===
Important Interfaces::
No important interfaces to be described yet.

==== LoMap Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

Purpose::
Describes the architecture of the inner LoMap system, it's how the system is structured and how each layer interacts within the system.
The architecture described in the diagram _System Level 1_ is a Clean Architecture.

Interfaces::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Interface|Description
|Entities|Represent the domain of the system, those classes that describe the enterprise business rules.
|App Business Logic|The use cases, the actual application business rules that describe how the application works.
|Presentation|The related documents that are in charge of the presentation of the application.
|Infrastructure|Those external interfaces that interact with the application, including the Database Management System, the APIs that are used (Map API), the PODs provider and any other external service.
