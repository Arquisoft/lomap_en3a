# What to code here

This part of the application, is more or less the core of everything. Here, everything is render 
with React. The UI communicates with the business logic which at the same time communicates 
with the database logic (in charge of sending and retrieving data from PODs).

# How to run the program locally

In case that you are interested in testing what you have already coded and see your code working 
you only need to run one of these commands depending on your purpose:
#### `npm start` :arrow_forward:
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test` :white_check_mark::white_check_mark::white_check_mark:
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
